Those can range from strict monitoring of food intake to a complete refusal to eat. People who are affected by anorexia avoid eating sufficient quantities of food and attempt to speed up their loss of weight by vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, and excessive athletic activity. The reason for this is their warped perception of their figure. As a result of these actions, the body weight is reduced to a body mass index value under 17.5. The body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the body’s weight (in kilograms, Kg) with the square of the body’s height (in meters). The BMI for a person of normal weight is 20-25. In contrast to people with anorexia, people with only bulimia (see the article on bulimia) have a BMI value over 17.5.",

This obstruction forces the heart to work more in order to propel blood to the body. This additional work limits eventually the quantity of blood the heart can pump. This again makes the heart muscle weak. If the narrowing is mild, symptoms might not be present. In severe cases, symptoms can be present and a surgery will usually be recommended to stretch or remove the affected valve and replace it.

Kidney stones are a common cause of pain in the groin, flank, or abdomen, and can cause blood in the urine. Kidney stones occur in 1 out of 20 persons during their lifetime.

"description": "Vasculitis is name given for the inflammation of certain blood vessels. Many conditions show through a vasculitis. Those conditions are differentiated depending on which parts of the vascular system, or which organs are affected. The Chapel-Hill-Classification describes vasculitides of the larger vessels (giant cell arteritis, Takayasu-arteritis), vasculitides of the medium vessels (polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease), vasculitides of the smaller vessels (Wegener’s disease, Churg Strauss Syndrome, anti-GBM disease, Henoch–Schönlein purpura), vasculitides of variable size (Cogan Syndrome, Behcet's disease) and vasculitides of an organ (cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, primary CNS vasculitis). Vasculitis can also occur in combination with other systemic conditions, e.g. rheumatoid diseases or systemic Lupus erythematosus. Vasculitis might as well be caused by a hepatitis B or C infection, by medication or malignant diseases.",

Most common causes for pulmonary oedema are a heart condition (cardiac insufficiency, heart attack, heart inflammation, arrhythmia, malfunctions of the valves).

"disease_name_professional": "Edema",
"description": "An edema is an excess of fluid storage in tissue. The most common type of oedema observed is calf oedema, but oedema can occur in other parts of the body, too. At certain levels, this accumulation of fluids in the calf is normal when sitting or standing for a long time. But a larger amount of fluid accumulation that does not decrease after walking or lying down should be examined more thoroughly. The reason for increased fluids in tissue is often an overloading of the vascular system, perhaps due to a weak heart (heart failure) or weakness of the leg veins (chronic vein insufficiency). A weakness in the lymphatic vessel system is rarely the cause, but it can lead to so-called lymphedema. However, this special form will not be described in this text.",
